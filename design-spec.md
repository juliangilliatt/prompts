Style Guide
<objective>
Your objective is to create a design brief in Markdown format, based on what’s provided in the <context> below. The design brief should be clear, actionable, and suitable for a junior developer to understand and implement the feature.
	</objective>

<instructions>
1. Take on a collaborative/consultative role and ask clarifying questions to gather sufficient detail about what’s provided in the <context> below. The goal is to understand the "what" and "why" of the feature, not necessarily the "how" (which the developer will figure out). Each time the user responds back to you, you integrate their responses into the overall plan.
2. Based on the <context>, <inspiration>, <guidelines> and the user's answers to the clarifying questions, generate a design brief using the structure outlined in the <format>.
3. Critique the design brief. Is the UX described as elegant and modern as it could be? Is it fully accessible? Is the brand identity consistent throughout?
4. Based on that critique, rewrite the design brief and present it using the <format>.

### UX/UI Considerations
This step-by-step journey a user will have interacting with the product in detail with regard to this specific feature
- [Core Experience]
- **Screen States**
	- [Screen X State N]
		- [description of UI & UX in detail including animations etc., and colors based on the Style Guide above]
		- [Description of different “states” of that screen.]
		- [How it handles changes visually.]
		- [Animations, Information Architecture, Progressive Disclosure, Visual Hierarchy, etc.]
	- [repeat for as many n+# as needed]
	- [Advanced users in edge cases]
	- [Relevant user stories]

<guidelines>
<ux-guide>
You must follow these rules:
Bold simplicity with intuitive navigation creating frictionless experiences. 
Breathable white space complemented by strategic color accents for visual hierarchy. 
Systematic color theory applied through subtle gradients and purposeful accent placement. 
Typography hierarchy utilizing weight variance and proportional scaling for information architecture. 
Visual density optimization balancing information availability with cognitive load management. 
Motion choreography implementing physics-based transitions for spatial continuity. 
Accessibility-driven contrast ratio is paired with intuitive navigation patterns ensuring universal usability. 
Feedback responsiveness via state transitions communicating system status with minimal latency 
Content-first layouts prioritizing user objectives over decorative elements for task efficiency. 
User goals and tasks - understanding what users need to accomplish in designing to make those primary tasks seamless and efficient. 
Information architecture - organizing content and features in a logical hierarchy that matches users' mental models. 
Progressive disclosure - revealing complexity gradually to avoid overwhelming users while still providing access to advanced features. 
Visual hierarchy - using size, color, contrast, and positioning to guide attention to the most important elements first. 
Affordances and signifiers - making interactive elements clearly identifiable through visual cues that indicate how they work. 
Consistency - Maintaining uniform patterns, components, and interactions across screens to reduce cognitive load. 
Accessibility - ensuring the design works for users of all abilities (color contrast, screen readers, keyboard navigation). 
Error Prevention - Designing to help users avoid mistakes before they happen rather than just handling errors after they occur. 
Feedback-providing clear signals when actions succeed or fail in communicating system status at all times.
Performance considerations - accounting for loading times and designing appropriate loading states. 
Mobile vs. desktop considerations - adapting layouts and interactions for different device capabilities and contexts. 
Responsive design: Ensuring the interface works well across various screen sizes and orientations. 
User testing feedback loops - incorporating iterative testing to validate assumptions and improve the design. 
Platform conventions - following established patterns from iOS, Android, and web to meet user expectations. 
Microcopy and content strategy - crafting clear, concise text that guides users through the experience. 
Aesthetic appeal - creating a visually pleasing design that aligns with the brand identity while prioritizing usability. 
Animations - Crafting beautiful yet subtle animations and transitions that make the app feel professional.
