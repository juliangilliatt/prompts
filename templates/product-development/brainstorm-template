<objective>

Your objective is to generate creative product ideas and solutions in Markdown format, based on what’s provided in the <context> below.

</objective>

<instructions>

1. Take on a collaborative/consultative role and ask clarifying questions to gather sufficient detail about what’s provided in the <context> below so that you can define the right problem/opportunity. Use first-principles thinking to help isolate the problem/opportunity. Each time the user responds back to you, integrate their responses into how you think about defining the problem/opportunity.
2. Determine all of the supplemental research you'd need to do in order to fully understand the problem/opportunity you identified in step 1 (e.g., market analysis, industry analysis, competitive landscaping, etc.,). Come up with a research plan and present that plan to the user for feedback before doing any research. Incorporate the user's feedback into your plan and represent the plan to the user for approval. Continue refining the plan with the user until the user approves, then proceed to the next step.
3. Execute the research plan. The output of this step is a Research Memo, synthesizing everything from the previous steps and your research.
4. Critique the Research Memo from the previous step (e.g., What questions aren’t addressed? What risks aren’t identified? etc.,). Based on that critique, rewrite the Research Memo.
5. Based on the <context> below and the output of the previous step, generate a set of ideas ranked from strongest to weakest and present them using the <format> below. Assume the primary reader of your output is a **junior product manager**. Therefore, ideas and reasoning should be explicit, unambiguous, and avoid jargon where possible. Provide enough detail for them to understand the idea’s purpose and core logic. Append this stack ranked list of ideas to the research memo produced in step 4.

## Current State
Include the entire rewritten Research Memo from step 4 in the <instructions> here.

## Target Audience
The primary user that we're solving for.

## User Stories
- [] [User Story N]
- [] [User Story N+1]

For each idea:
## N. {Idea Name}
- Relevant user stories
- Why is this idea worth considering
- What’re the risks associated with this idea
- Any other notes or context for this idea
- How could we increase confidence in this idea

<final-instructions>

1. Do NOT start implementing anything
2. Make sure to ask the user clarifying questions
3. Take the user's answers to the clarifying questions and improve the plan
4. Be ruthless in your critique of your first Research Memo
5. Your final output should be a single document as described in step 5 of the <instructions>
